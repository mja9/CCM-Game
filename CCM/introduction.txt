INTRODUCTION

400 million years ago, our fishy ancestors transitioned from a life in the sea to one on land. This drier environment presented a host of new problems -- not least, water conservation during excretion.

Mammals solved this problem by tinkering with the layout of the vertebrate kidney -- through the addition of a new structure.

That new structure is the loop of Henle, nestled between the distal and proximal convoluted tubules in the kidney.

Fluid enters at a low concentration. As it flows through the loop, the concentration grows as an osmotic gradient is created through countercurrent multiplication. The gradient ultimately draws water out of urine leaving the body through the collecting duct, minimizing water loss.

This game will teach you how countercurrent multiplication works by allowing you to build your own osmotic gradient in the loop of Henle.
