# CCM-Game

This game is an online adaptation of an in-person educational activty developed at 
Rice University by Dr. Beth Beason-Abmayr and Dr. David R. Caprette. The purpose of the
game is to teach biosciences students about the counter-current multiplication mechanism
within the mammalian kidney.

The game is free to use/fork for any physiology educator or student. The game is 
currently being hosted at http://mja9.web.rice.edu/CCM-Game/ but will soon be moved to 
its permanent home at https://kidney-ccm.rice.edu.


For questions regarding the history of the teaching tool, you can contact Dr. Beth Beason-Abmayr
